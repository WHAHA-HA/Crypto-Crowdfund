          Privacy is a fundamental right, and at Crypto Crowdfund and its group
          companies, it is treated as such. This document sets forth our current

        <p className={sharedClasses.p}>
          Our business is founded on the principle that people matter. Respect
          for people is the foundation of our business. Respect for people
          includes respecting their right to privacy.

          We are engaged in the business of using innovative ways to bring
          health to all in India. Our website seeks to bring cases of those in
          need of healthcare and other essential services to the attention of
          those in a position to make a difference and the opportunity to do so.
          The users of our website are those in need and those seeking to help.

        <p className={sharedClasses.p}>
          In the conduct of our business, we collect and process personal data
          of our users and visitors. Personal data is collected in the course of
          transacting on the website. Personal data is also collected by Crypto
          Crowdfund and its affiliates outside of website through in-person
          meetings, participation in conferences and other business forums,
          transaction or promotion of business, and with respect to job
          applicants, through job application materials and interviews. Personal
          data is also collected through social media; from solicited and
          unsolicited communications; responses to promotional and other
          materials, among others. If your personal data is available with us,
          more likely than not, it has been shared by you with us.
        </p>
        <p className={sharedClasses.p}>
          Data collection technologies built into our websites,
          telecommunication systems, digital advertising, social media, etc. are
          additional sources of personal data collection. In addition to
          personal data that a user voluntarily furnishes, these electronic
          systems also collect personal data without the knowledge of the user,
          including user’s preferences, frequency of access, IP addresses, type
          of browser, communication device or operating systems used, and
          geographic location, etc.

        <h2 className={sharedClasses.h2}>Processing of Personal Data</h2>

        <p className={sharedClasses.p}>
          We acquire, maintain and process personal data where it is necessary
          for the pursuit of legitimate business interests, balancing this
          interest against the data subject’s interests and fundamental rights.
          Legitimate interests include establishing and maintaining
          relationships, servicing their anticipated and actual needs, and for
          administrative purposes. Towards that end, we may use various contact
          management, analytics and processing software and other tools and
          techniques, including marketing by use of electronic means.
        </p>
        <p className={sharedClasses.p}>
          We may share personal data with one or more of our group companies for
          performance of business functions and for internal analytics. Some of
          our group companies or service providers may be located in
          jurisdictions that are outside of the jurisdiction of the personal
          data subject, or in jurisdictions that offer a lower level of privacy
          or data protection. In such circumstances, we have put in place
          appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable law and in line
          with this policy.
        </p>

        <p className={sharedClasses.p}>
          We may also process personal data where it is necessary for entering
          into or performing under a contract. Finally, in certain
          circumstances, we may process personal data on the basis of consent of
          the data subject for specific purposes.
        </p>

        <p className={sharedClasses.p}>
          We may also use or disclose personal data if we are required by law to
          do so or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary
          to protect our rights and/or to comply with judicial or regulatory
          proceedings, a court order or other legal process. We do not otherwise
          disclose or sell to any third party any personal data that we collect
          or which comes into our possession without the consent of the data
          subject. The only exception to the foregoing is where any part of our
          business is sold to a third party, in which case the acquiror of the
          business will likely also acquire personal data in our possession or
          control.
